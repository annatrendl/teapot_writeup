## Suggestions for Discussion

The attraction effect is somewhat fragile. Changing the ordering of the three alternatives when they are presented sequentially can reverse the attraction effect \cite{EvansHolmesDasariTrueblood19} and altering the presentation of the attribute by alternative matrix can also reverse the attraction effect \cite{CataldoCohen18}.
