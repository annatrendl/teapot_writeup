Here are some references to the inventors of MDS to shoehorn in:

p. 5. The Trueblood model does have the weird 45 degree rotation going on---not sure what that means. But it also is ballistic, which means no switching of attention over time. So probably soften to "most of the sequential sampling models"

2.2.1. one-unit = two-units. What units? The 0-1 scale is our arbitrary invention. 

"...the dark blue line is thus the reflection of the red line." p. 7. I struggled to understand this paragraph. Also if you say reflection, you have to say where the "mirror" is!

upper halve -> upper half

Why is Figure 1 not square, given the units are arbitrary?

"which crosses the red line at a value of £328." This is not a value on the x or y axis. It is a value contour given by the rule.

Figure 2 doesn't help!

2.2.2. Delete first paragraph, move some to stimuli.

"In the numerical condition, we invited participants to try
to infer the trade-off between the two attribute dimensions before starting the
practice stage." Did we? I recall seeing single teapots and typing in a value and then getting the correct answer. But this is wrong of me? It was really like Figure 4.


Let's call it "learning stage" and "choice stage". "Practice" sounds like a practice of the choice stage.

"lowest 2.5% of the entropy distribution" say across response buttons?

"Out of the 86 people, 61 completed both the pictorial and numeric conditions." ... in the 50 minutes allowed.

Figure 7 better as a frequency count histogram?

"identifying dominated options" But they chose the _dominating_ option on catch trials, so they were identifying the _dominating_ option

"In addition,
the decoy was never chosen in 45% of the numerical and 10% of the pictorial
conditions, which indicates that participants found it much easier to identify the
decoy in the numerical condition." Seems to disagree with Figure 7 where the decoy is chosen no more than 10% of the time for most people.

Figure 8. Say what exactly "Scaled RT" is. Is it in seconds. I couldn't work out why we are checking RTs. We don't have a prediction.

Table 1. Square brackes for CIs?

34%, 95% CI [13, 59] -> 13%, 59%. CI limits have units too.

p. 20 references missing, appear as ?

The discussion at the end of the results section is for the Discussion.

Discussion can be brief, but should also say we found no attraction effect for numerical or perceptual in the first block.
